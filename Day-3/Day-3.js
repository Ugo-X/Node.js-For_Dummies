// CREATING OUR OWN MODULES
// refer to https.js/response and request.js

// Caching in Node
// to prevent code/command that are part of a module to be run multiple TimeRanges, it maintains a cache of required modules which is like a data base of modules.This cache is global and you can access it by using require.cache or "import.cache". This way even if the module is required multiple times, the code in the module will run only once.

// you cannot edit a required function


// INDEX.JS
// index js enables a folder to be treated as a module using the require property
