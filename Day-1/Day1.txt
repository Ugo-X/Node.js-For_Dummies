# NODE
* What is Node?
* Brief intro
 * The concept of running javascript code in our browser spans off from the browsers having an enabler, usually called a javascript engine. A javascript engine is a software component typically within a browser or other runtime environments like node, that executes JavaScript code.
 Examples of javascript engines and their corresponding browsers are:
 ** V8 used in google chrome
 ** SpiderMonkey used by Mozilla in firefox and 
 ** JavaScriptCore used by Apple for it's safari browser 

# Node is a Javascript runtime environment that employs the use of google's V8 javascript engine. 


# what is a runtime and what are the peculiarities as concerns node in particular 

In relation to Node.js, a runtime environment refers to the software platform that executes your Node.js code. It provides the necessary resources and functionalities for your code to run effectively. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

** Node.js as a JavaScript Runtime:

- Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily executed within web browsers. Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines that interpret and run the code, allowing for interactive web pages.
- Node.js, however, is a different kind of JavaScript runtime environment. It's designed to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, specifically on the server-side.

** Components of a Node.js Runtime Environment:

- ** JavaScript Engine: At its core, Node.js relies on a JavaScript engine, similar to those found in web browsers. A popular example is the V8 engine developed by Google, which is also used in Chrome. The engine interprets and executes your Node.js code.
- ** Event Loop: Node.js employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O (Input/Output) model. This means it can handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for one operation to complete before starting another. The event loop manages asynchronous operations and callbacks, ensuring efficient handling of requests and responses.
- ** Modules: Node.js leverages a rich ecosystem of modules (also called packages) that provide additional functionalities. These modules can be installed using the Node Package Manager (npm) and used in your code to perform various tasks like file system access, database interaction, network communication, and more.
- ** Built-in APIs: Node.js provides a set of built-in APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that offer functionalities specific to server-side development. These APIs allow your code to interact with the underlying operating system, network, and file system.

** Key Points about Node.js Runtime:

- ** Flexibility: The Node.js runtime allows you to write server-side applications using JavaScript, a language traditionally used for front-end web development. This enables a more unified approach to development for both front-end and back-end components.
- ** Efficiency: The event loop model and non-blocking I/O make Node.js efficient at handling concurrent requests, particularly for applications dealing with real-time data or large numbers of connections.
- ** Scalability: Node.js applications can scale horizontally by adding more server instances to handle increased traffic, making them suitable for building scalable web services.

** In Summary:

The Node.js runtime environment provides the foundation for running your JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It offers a JavaScript engine, event loop, modular system, and built-in APIs to enable efficient and scalable server-side development.
